# This is a "headless" bundle so this file will not render in site.
# each file in the bundle is an individual item for the FAQ (contained in ../faq.markdown).
#
# The files in this bundle are named specifically using this format
# `<category>-<sequence>-<slug>.markdown`
# This ensure coherence between updates (e.g. FAQ items will always show in the same sort order in each category).
